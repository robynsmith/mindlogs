Note: [WIP] Work in Progress for sure!

This is an attempt at writing a logger for pomodoros.

At least for now, it does not include a timer but is mostly a command-line tool for recording effort & timestamps.

This should help with tracking effort, in much the same way that logging on a service helps you keep track of what
the service is up to.
